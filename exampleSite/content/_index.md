title: Just start writing
description: When wishing to free the words, just start writing.

There is nothing better than expressing yourself with the written word.  There's an intimacy associated with the teamwork between your brain, your inner voice speaking out the words, your hands and fingers fashioning the characters before you, and your eyes closing the loop by reading what has just appeared. 

That is your personal and private loop; a unique experience that you'll only ever re-create in a similar fashion but the words will be different and so will the thoughts.

Writing is a one off.
