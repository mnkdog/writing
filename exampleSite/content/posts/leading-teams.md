## Context
I have adjusted how I lead teams and people over the years. I claim not to have *the best*, finely tuned, method; just a method that works for me and appears to have worked for the people I have led. What follows are my notes on the topic.

## The Parameters
My view of team and people leadership comprises several elements:
- Aligning teams with organisation goals, and individuals with team goals
- Observing progress towards goals
- Correcting path towards goals
- All whilst maintaining a happy, challenged, progressive team

Sounds easy, but it's not!

## Aligning teams with organisation goals, and individuals with team goals

In short, start with the top 2 or 3 company goals (*increase revenue to X* or *increase customer conversion to X%*), and create team objectives that help achieve those. Then create objectives for each team individual that help achieve the team's objectives.
Creating individual's objectives that are not aligned to company goals may be worthless.
Over time I have come to value it more when organisational goals are at the team level and for the individual level it is best to have personal goals, such as progression from a front end developer to a full stack developer.

## Observing progress towards goals
### Individual's goals
I create a spreadsheet for each individual on my team and explain it is *their* personal spreadsheet and not shared with HR or anyone else. 
Once we agree on objectives, I add them to the very top, one per column, of the spreadsheet.

Above, you will see there are two *output* related, and measurable, objectives. I could add a metric in there (or key result, as Andy Grove called them) such as, speed up CI process by an average of 20%. I do not do this at the start but sometimes add metrics in as we progress through the weeks.

I also add a personal growth type objective (third column), such as *learn to write basic automation scripts* or *become the company advocate for API testing*. This is to give the person some growth that isn't just transactional 'nail bashing' work. No-one wants objectives that say 'bash in 50 nails per hour'!

I make clear I **will** hold them accountable for achieving the objectives and that they should hold me accountable, too, for my part in enabling this progress. 

The first entry will have a first challenge towards achieving each objective.

Each time we meet (it must be fortnightly, otherwise corrections required can be problematic and progress lost) we note down comments on a new row in the spreadsheet.
